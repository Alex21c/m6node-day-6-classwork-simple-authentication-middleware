## Overview : 
Logging middleware is a software component that sits between the client and server in a web application, intercepting incoming requests and outgoing responses to log relevant information. It captures details such as request headers, parameters, payloads, response status codes, and timestamps. This middleware helps developers monitor and debug their applications by providing visibility into request-response cycles, error logging, performance metrics, and security events. It typically integrates with logging frameworks to record this information in log files or send it to logging services for analysis.

## Task :
Created a logging middleware for my Express application. This middleware should log information about each incoming request, including:
+ the HTTP method,
+ the requested URL, and 
+ the timestamp
+ Additionally, log the time taken for processing the request.
